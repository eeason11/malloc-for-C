Main Files:
***********

mm.c
	Your solution malloc package. This is the file that you
	will be handing in, and is the only file you should modify.

mdriver.c	
	The malloc driver that tests your mm.c file

mdriver
        Once you've run make, run ./mdriver to test your solution.

traces/
	Directory that contains the trace files that the driver uses
	to test your solution. Files corners.rep, short2.rep, and malloc.rep
	are tiny trace files that you can use for debugging correctness.

**********************************
Other support files for the driver
**********************************

config.h	Configures the malloc driver
fsecs.{c,h}	Wrapper function for the different timer packages
clock.{c,h}	Routines for accessing the Pentium and Alpha cycle counters
fcyc.{c,h}	Timer functions based on cycle counters
ftimer.{c,h}	Timer functions based on interval timers and gettimeofday()
memlib.{c,h}	Models the heap and sbrk function

*******************************
Building and running the driver
*******************************
To build the driver, type "make" to the shell.

To run the driver on a tiny test trace:

	unix> ./mdriver -f traces/malloc.rep

To get a list of the driver flags:

	unix> ./mdriver -h
